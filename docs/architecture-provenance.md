# Architecture diagram provenance

Browser requests the loopback Python API; current JSON evidence is selected after latest revision/site-role checks. Default CPU retrieval is token_overlap. Optional Ollama/Qwen extraction is source-validated and CPU rules construct provisional hypotheses. Reviewer decisions and audits are stored in SQLite. No vector database, embedding model or active n8n exists.

PNG is the inline README asset; SVG is the editable, fully embedded source. Six compact cards use actual technology glyphs where available. JSON braces are a locally authored functional symbol. Browser contains the JavaScript glyph for the vanilla client. The undirected Ollama/Qwen link denotes runtime/model association; dashed arrows are optional requests and returned proposals, not parallel GPU workers. The solid Python/SQLite arrow denotes server-owned persistence after human review.

Inspected source commit: 8422c5c6b4aa787d13386f0e6f70b97c3da2c244. Diagram generation does not rerun a model or change benchmark results. Final PNG pixels and an actual 360px-wide CPU browser capture were visually inspected; technology labels are 28px in the 720px source (14px at 360px display).

Reference style: user-supplied synthetic-logo-rendering-compatibility-test.png, version1, 800x510, SHA256 c6ad5fda762ea72fb40020e56e6242d74b86c9adff00d95b8027f7981e250df8. The supported Library consumer download was completed with verified identity/version metadata on Linux and its actual pixels were viewed on the consumer workspace. Windows does not support the helper extended attributes; the original Linux materialization retains them. Its synthetic model topology is not copied.
